MusicManagement CSharp
======================

This shall become a tool to simplify my convoluted audio disc ripping
process. Development is slow at the moment, and changes only come
trickling in.

It is a reimplementation of my [music-management-scripts][mms] in C#
using the .NET  framework. Those scripts work, but because my Python
knowledge is rudimentary the Python code is not at the level of
quality I'd produce professionally. C# is much closer to my wheelhouse
and I have always been interested in that language and the .NET
framework. Therefore, it should result in a higher quality‚Ñ¢Ô∏è solution.

Since the core logic already exists, I "merely" need to translate it
to another language. I am using this project to become more acquainted
with C#. I am planning to do the same in C++ in parallel, which should
be simpler because it is what I have developed in for many years early
in my career as a software developer.

Let's see which implementation finishes first - if any üòÖ

For now, please refer to the Python scripts for more details and for
actually working code.
